How the Central Assistance will be released to beneficiaries for individual house construction?
Central Assistance will be released to the bank accounts of beneficiaries identified in projects through States/UTs as per recommendations of State/UT.

How the subsidy is to be released to beneficiaries?
The subsidy would be released by the CNAs based on the disbursements made by PLIs to the beneficiaries. Subsidy, so disbursed by the CNA to the PLI, will be credited by the PLI to the borrower’s account upfront by deducting it from the principal loan amount. As a result, the borrower will pay EMI on the remainder of the principal loan amount. E.g., the borrower avails a loan for Rs. 6.00 lakhs and subsidy thereon works out to Rs. 2.20 lakhs, the amount (Rs. 2.20 lakhs) would be reduced upfront from the loan (i.e., the loan would reduce to Rs. 3.80 lakhs) and the borrower would pay EMIs on the reduced amount of Rs. 3.80 lakhs
