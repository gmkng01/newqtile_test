Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) for ensuring housing for all in urban areas was launched on 25th June 2015 providing pucca houses to all eligible beneficiaries by 2022. The Mission provides Central Assistance to implementing agencies through States/Union Territories (UTs) and Central Nodal Agencies (CNAs) for providing houses to all eligible families/ beneficiaries against the validated demand for houses for about 1.12 cr. PMAY(U) has made a mandatory provision for the female head of the family to be the owner or co-owner of the house under this Mission. A basket of options is adopted to ensure more number of people depending on their income, finance and availability of land through following four options.

1. “In-situ” Slum Redevelopment (ISSR)

2. Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS)

3. Affordable Housing in Partnership (AHP)

4. Beneficiary-led individual house construction/enhancements (BLC)
